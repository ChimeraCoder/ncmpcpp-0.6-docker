ncmpcpp 0.6.4 Docker Image
========================


## What?


[ncmpcpp](http://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/) is a fantastic music client. This Docker image runs ncmpcpp 0.6 inside a Docker container which controls mpd running natively on the host.


## Why?


ncmpcpp 0.7 and later does not support filtering. ncmpcpp 0.6, which does, is cumbersome to install on the latest versions of Ubuntu and Debian - the official repositories only include 0.5 and 0.7 due to the timing of the release cycles, and several key dependencies have been renamed.


Fortunately, it's easy to run ncmpcpp inside a Docker container even if mpd is running on a host. That way, you don't have to worry about making sure your music library is accessible to mpd inside a container, but you also don't have to worry about installing a custom version of ncmpcpp on your host.
